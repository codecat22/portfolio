		description:
			'This project, created for the Machine Learning Workshop course, is a program which performs style transfer from one image to another: in simple terms, it takes two images as input - one from which the style will be extracted and one to which it will be applied - and outputs a filtered version of the content image, changed to emulate the chosen style. The algorithm is largely based on a 2015 paper called “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge.'

			'My Bachelor’s thesis, in collaboration with Marin Karamihalev and under the supervision of dr inż. Rafał Jóźwiak, focuses on an automatic web system for downloading, processing, and visualizing precipitation data obtained via NASA’s Global Precipitation Measurement Mission. The system was developed for use by the Warsaw-based firm Satagro, which provides farmers with data useful in determining crop maintenance needs and predicting crop yields.'
